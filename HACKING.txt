Running Tests
-------------

To run the full test suite (your system will need Python 2.6 and 2.7 to be
installed):

- Install "tox" (``easy_install tox``).

- Run ``tox`` from within the top-level ``substanced`` directory.

To run tests for a single version of Python:

- Run ``setup.py dev`` (this will install ``coverage`` and ``nose``).

- Run ``setup.py nosetests``.

To run coverage tests for a single version of Python:

- Run ``setup.py dev`` (this will install ``coverage`` and ``nose``).

- Run ``setup.py nosetests --with-coverage``.

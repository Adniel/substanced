- Allow more than one permission to be assigned to a principal in the acl
  edit view.

- Make acl edit view not look weird at small resolutions.

- Cut, copy, paste, rename, import/export.

- XML-RPC.

- Figure out a way to mutate ACLs when a principal referred to by one is
  deleted.  Maybe change ACL such that the principal id is replaced by an
  unobtainable object id.

- Decide whether to split "manage contents" permissions out for folders into
  add, delete, rename.

- Folder contents sorting (by name, by type).

- Catalog management (reindex, view index contents).

- Object map management (view relationships, view paths, view objectids).

- Database management (pack, see activity, see cache parameters, flush cache).

- Figure out how to let people override generic add view.

- Undo recent transactions (per folder?)

- Path index CQE syntax.

- Scaffold.

- Multiple property sheets on single content object.

- Configurable management prefix.

- Allow more than one permission to be assigned to a principal in the acl
  edit view.

- Make acl edit view not look weird at small resolutions.

- Cut, copy, paste.

- XML-RPC.

- Undo last action.

- Figure out a way to mutate ACLs when a principal referred to by one is
  deleted.  Maybe change ACL such that the principal id is replaced by an
  unobtainable object id.

UI-Plus-Guts
------------

- Import/export from folder contents view.

- Add Undo tab to Site (or per folder?) which will allow admins to undo recent
  transactions.  Implied: add transaction notes to all transactions.

- Stamp created objects with creator information?

- Allow reordering of resources in folder contents view when the folder is
  ordered.

- Change password tab on user object requires old password.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/issues/19

- Show a derivative of output status in flash message when update indexes is
  done to a catalog.

Guts-Only
---------

- Use hasattr(__is_folder__) instead of IFolder.providedBy is is_folder.

- Use is_folder view predicate instead of context=IFolder in folder views
  (holdup is testing out folder button action overrides in the face of views
  being registered against IFolder).

- Decide whether to split "manage contents" permissions out for folders into
  add, delete, rename.

- Catalog event subscriber currently does a hellishly expensive recatalog of
  allowed indexes when an ACL is changed.  Not sure if there's even a general
  way to make this do less work, but could be.

- Undo of catalog reindex doesnt?  Turned off for now.

- Add specific configurator directives for object event registrations
  (e.g. config.subscribe_modified).

- __viewable__, __renameable__, __deletable__, __copyable__, __duplicatable__
  attributes of contained objects in folder contents view that controls
  how contained object can be acted upon?  E.g.::

    def __viewable__(self, context, request):
        return has_permission('sdi.view', context, request)

- How to prevent objects from being moved or duplicated into a place where
  they're not addable?

- Fix ``Batch`` such that seqlen is a maximum.  Rationale: the sequence that
  the batch receives may be smaller than seqlen due to hidden objects in
  folder contents view.

- Once we depend on Pyramid 1.4b1+, normalize subscriber predicate argument
  lists.

- Change all mentions of ``context`` to ``resource``.

- Add a ``substanced.load_dump`` key for use by root factory.

- Evolution execution needs to be sorted by package.

- Evolution should show the derived versions after a ``--latest``, not the
  versions that were current before.

UI-Only
-------

- Show spinner when a button is pressed that leads to another page
  (e.g. reindex or duplicate).

Nice-to-Have Features
---------------------

- XML-RPC.

- Drag and drop ACE reordering in ACL edit view.

- Ability to add and edit principals in existing ACEs in ACL edit view.

Dump and Load
-------------

- Explain ``__dump__`` and ``__load__`` methods of resources.

Grid
----

- Explain __sdi_deletable__, __sdi_addable__, __sdi_hidden__, __sdi_columns__,
  __sdi_buttons__.


Events
------

- Explain event listener decorators and add_content_subscriber.

- Explain subscribe_acl_modified.

- Explain "moving" and "duplicating" flags on added and removed events.

Security
--------

- Explain that allowed indexes are reindexed when an object's ACL is changed.

- Explain change_acl.

- Explain that source-integral PrincipalToACLBearing relationships are set up
  between an ACL-bearing object and the principals referred to within the ACL.

Docs
----

- Explain __init__.py include-then-scan done by includeme and how to avoid
  scanning.

Probably Bad Ideas
------------------

- Create "addable here" API that manages the __sdi_addable__ attribute of a
  folderish object.

- Emit an ObjectMoving event rather than removed event with a moving flag,
  then an add event?

- Create object map management UI (view relationships, view paths, view
  objectids).

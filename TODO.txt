UI-Only
-------

- Make acl edit view not look weird at smaller resolutions.

- Allow folder contents UI ("Contents" tab) sorting by name and by type.

- Make batching in contents view use bootstrap batching UI elements.

UI-Plus-Guts
------------

- Create object map management UI (view relationships, view paths, view
  objectids).

- Improve database management UI ("Manage DB") in site package (see activity,
  see cache parameters, flush cache).

- Improve catalog management UI.  We currently allow someone to reindex the
  entire catalog via the "Manage" tab of a catalog.  Instead, we should allow
  them to reindex individual persistent indices or all persistent indices.
  We should also allow them to, separately, refresh the indexes in persistent
  space based on the current state of the registry resulting from
  "add_catalog_index".

- Allow cut, copy, paste, rename, (import/export?) from contents view.

- Add Undo tab to Site (or per folder?) which will allow admins to undo recent
  transactions.

- Allow multiple property sheets on single content object.

- Stamp created objects with creator information?

- Forgot password / change password interactions.

- Allow services to be added to services folder via add view UIs.

Guts-Only
---------

- Figure out how to let people override generic add view.

- Create a scaffold.

- Path index CQE syntax.

- Substance D ACLs contain object identifiers which refer to principals.
  Currently, when a principal is deleted, ACLs which refer to the principal
  are not adjusted.  This is both a security issue and a sanity issue.  The
  object id of a deleted principal is put back into the set of object ids
  that are grantable to future objects.  As a result, some other principal
  may wind up with an object id that used to belong to a deleted principal,
  and he may inappropriately be granted access due to stale ACLs that
  possesses that object id.  Some object that is not a principal might wind
  up with that object id, and undefined things will happen.

  Here's what would be nice: when an ACL is changed or added, using the
  object map, form relationships between the principal objects it names and
  the ACL-bearing object.  When a principal is deleted, change the ACL of all
  such-related objects so that the deleted principal id in the ACL is
  replaced by an unobtainable object id.

  Note that a variant of this bug/feature has existed in Zope for 13 years,
  and it hasn't seemed to have raised much ire, but it always bugged me.

- Decide whether to split "manage contents" permissions out for folders into
  add, delete, rename.

- ACL edit view currently retatalogs an object based on the presence or
  absence of an "allowed" index.  This is wrong.

- Bake ACLs into the object map.

- Wrap factories that are functions which produce content in something that
  attaches the category interface directly to its result.

Nice-to-Have Features
---------------------

- XML-RPC.

- Workflow.

- Drag and drop ACE reordering in ACL edit view.

- Ability to add and edit principals in existing ACEs in ACL edit view.

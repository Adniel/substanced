The current way we do indexing and searching of catalog data bugs me.  Here is
the status quo:

- A catalog is treated as a collection of indexes.

- A catalog is treated as a service that can be looked up via lineage.

- Any number of catalogs can be placed in a particular lineage, but an
  application always searches for "the catalog", and finds the first one.

- Every index is treated as a query generator.

- A catalog has a web UI that allows people to add and remove indexes.

As an upshot of some of the above traits, right now you can do:

   catalog = find_service(someresource, 'catalog')
   someindex = catalog['someindex']
   someotherindex = catalog['someotherindex']
   q = someindex.eq('foo') & someotherindex.eq('bar')
   resultset = q.execute()

You can also add an index to the catalog either through code or through the
web, and you can reindex a particular index or all the indexes in a catalog via
the same web UI.

These traits are fine and this mode of operation seems ok, except the concept
of a catalog as a singleton service that is a singleton collection of indexes
makes it tricky to compose applications together within the same system.

If an application wants to add/use a set of indexes, it must do one of the
following:

- create its own catalog

- add indexes to an existing catalog.

Neither is optimal.

If the application must create its own catalog, it means the application can't
be "aspecty": it needs to have a root of some kind where its catalog lives.
When an application has its own catalog, it also becomes more difficult to use
the indexes from another application (or the "system index") in queries related
to that application.

If the application must add indexes to an existing catalog, it means that
different applications will compete over the composition and naming of indexes
in that catalog.

Because every catalog can have indexes added to it and removed from it
manually, mucking around with it can break an application which depends on one
of its indexes.  A code change that requires an additional index requires the
developer to write adhoc code to add such an index to "the catalog"; that index
name may already be taken by another application (using a different index
type), so when the adhoc code is run it may break.  Likewise, removing an index
using the web interface may break an application.

In the meantime, there's somewhat of an ideal situation now in the Substance D
workflow tool, where a workflow is described entirely in code.  Although the
state of each workflow in the system is stored on a resource that participates
in each of those workflows, the workflow state and transitions definitions are
never stored in the database.  This means when a workflow is changed, it's
often only the related code that needs changing, and the database needn't be
touched unless an evolve needs to be done because a workflow was renamed or
removed.

My proposal to change some of this is this:

- Recognize that every catalog is related to an application inasmuch as that
  application requires a collection of named indexes, each of which must be a
  specific type.  Code in the application depends on a particular arrangement
  of indices and will break if it does not exist.

- Recognize that the index definitions related to a particular application can
  be spelled declaratively in configuration.  We should make the definition of
  an index set as declarative as possible, applying changes to database
  catalogs based on changes to the declarative stuff as necessary.

- Recognize that catalogs and catalog indices are not really content and
  probably shouldn't be addable or removable like other content except via
  scripting.  They will need to be *viewable* via the SDI (at least to allow
  reindexing and perusal of contained data), but they don't need to be addable
  and removeable via the web.  Even via scripting, the adding and removing of
  them shouldn't be encouraged to be very imperative; it should be done by
  "applying" a new delcarative configuration of indices to a particular catalog
  index in the database, rather than writing purely imperative code to add and
  remove indexes.

This is superior to the status quo because idiomatic catalog usage could begin
to look like:

  # in app1 configuration startup code

  def includeme(config):
      orders = FieldIndexFactory
      lineitems = FieldIndexFactory
      config.add_catalog_factory(
          'app1', 
          {'orders:orders, 'lineitems':lineitems}
          )

  @subscriber(ApplicationCreated)
  def add_app1_catalog(event):
      if not 'catalogs' in event.app.root:
          catalogs = event.app.root.add_service('catalogs')
          if not 'app1' in catalogs:
              catalog = catalogs.add_catalog('app1')
              catalog.sync() # reindexes

  # in substanced.sdi configuration startup code

  def includeme(config):
      name = FieldIndexFactory
      interfaces = FieldIndexFactory
      config.add_catalog_factory(
          'sdi', 
          {'name':name, 'interfaces':interfaces}
          )
   
  @subscriber(ApplicationCreated)
  def add_sdi_catalog(event):
      if not 'catalogs' in event.app.root:
          catalogs = event.app.root.add_service('catalogs')
          if not 'sdi' in catalogs:
              catalog = catalogs.add_catalog('sdi')
              catalog.sync() # reindexes
   
  # in view code

  from substanced.util import find_catalog

  def aview(context, request):
      app1_catalog = find_catalog(context, 'app1')
      sdi_catalog = find_catalog(context, 'sdi')
      q = ( app1_catalog['orders'].eq(request.GET['orderid']) &
            sdi_catalog['interfaces'].eq(IOrder) )
      resultset = q.execute()
      ...

- Applications no longer compete over index names, because they don't share the
  same catalog.

- You can still compose queries across different index sets because they're
  named and accessible by name.

- Aspecty applications can avoid changing any existing catalog owned by a
  different application. Instead they can add a new catalog without breaking
  existing applications or requiring a root object owned by that application in
  which to place the new catalog.  Example: the SDI itself, which badly wants a
  "search box".

- The canonical definition of the indexes related to a particular application
  are kept in code.  Instances of such catalogs can be added anywhere in the
  tree (e.g. via ``catalogs.add_catalog('sdi')`` as above).

Requirements:

- A capabilitiy for "extents" in order to allow us to find existing catalogs
  for index addition/removal/reindexing once the definition of indexes stored
  in code related to an application changes.  This is mostly a nicety to allow
  for automated reindexing of all indexes related to a particular application
  without any database layout knowledge; e.g. during development you could have
  self-managing index addition and removal at startup.

- Figure out how application code defines a "catalog view" for indexing.
  Currently there's only one catalog view per content type (because there's
  only one catalog type), but there may need to be multiple if an object needs
  to be indexed in multiple catalogs belonging to multiple different
  applications (e.g. both the "sdi" catalog and the "app1" catalog).

      <li>Has a management interface that allows you to edit and add content
          (aka an "admin" interface)</li>
      <li>Has features which allow you to define your own content types for
          management and arbitrary application development purposes</li>
      <li>Allows the application of object-level (aka "row-level") security to content objects.</li>
